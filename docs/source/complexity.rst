Complex Algorithms
==================

While the bot is simple, several elements require explanation:

- `find_movie()` encodes the user input using `quote()` to avoid issues with special characters.
- `response_message` is a formatted string combining multiple movie attributes in a user-readable format.
- Poster display depends on whether the poster link is valid (not 'N/A').

The trailer link is generated by searching YouTube without using its API â€” this simplifies implementation, but may affect accuracy.
